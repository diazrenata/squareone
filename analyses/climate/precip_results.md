## Summary

Precipitation and min temp seem to have had a low/high period since
2010, respectively. The number of days \> 35 C have increased since the
early 2000s. Mean and min temps have may have weakly increased, but itâ€™s
iffy.

None of these shifts is as pronounced as the shift towards lower precip
and higher temps seen from the late 1980s - early 1990s.

I think the drought index captures this story more succintly.

## Precipitation

### Precip anomaly

All of the anomalies come from `portalr::weather()`. Major hat tip to
Glenda for writing that function and putting me on this approach to
plotting anomalies (see also the aesthetic for NDVI, drought.)

Monthly precip / PRISM 30-year normal.

### Summer precip

Calculated as the total precipitation from April-September each year,
visualized as the proportion of the long term mean.

There is a notable drop approaching 2020, but note that 2005-2015 is not
extraordinary compared to the 1990s-2000s.

### Winter precip

Calculated as the total precipitation from October-March the following
year, visualized as the proportion of the long term mean.
