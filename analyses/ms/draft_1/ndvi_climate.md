# NDVI

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

Monthly NDVI (mean NDVI from Landsat 5, 7, and 8) difference from
long-term mean for each month from January 1988-January 2020.

# Precipitation

## Total precipitation

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

Monthly precipitation anomaly as a proportion of the 30-year PRISM
normal.

## Summer precipitation

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

Summer precipitation (total precipitation from April-September per year)
as a proportion of the long-term mean.

## Winter precipitation

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Winter precipitation (total precipitation from October-March the
following year) as a proportion of the long-term mean.

# Temperature

## Mean temperature

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

Mean temperature anomaly as difference from the 30-year PRISM normal.

## Days above 35 C

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

Number of days per calendar year when maximum temperature \> 35C;
anomaly calculated as difference from long term mean.

## Min temperature

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

Min temperature anomaly as difference from the 30-year PRISM normal.

## Max temperature

![](ndvi_climate_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

Max temperature anomaly as difference from the 30-year PRISM normal.
