## Compensation and total energy use

Lines are 6-month moving averages. Horizontal lines + ribbons are means
and SE or CL from GLM or GLS.

### Compensation

**Compensation** refers to compensatory gains in energy use by small
granivores on exclosure plots relative to controls. Calculated as
\(\frac{SmgranExclosure - SmgranControl}{DipoControl}\). **Total
energy** refers to the overall loss in energy use caused by kangaroo rat
removal.
