## Summary

The period since 2010 has had two periods of long and severe drought,
longer and more severe than previous successive droughts, interspersed
with a relatively wet wet period (compared to the 2000s). However, there
have been several droughts - including a single long, severe drought in
the early 2000s - that did not coincide with major shifts in the
rodents.
