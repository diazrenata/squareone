# Summary - For Morgan

Overall, I think the biggest tasks directly responding to reviewer comments are:

- Testing sensitivity to removing an exclosure plot (to achieve a balanced set of 4 control and 4 exclosure plots)
- Adding the figure using biomass as the currency rather than energy.

Having coded both of these up quickly, neither seems to qualitatively affect the results.

Because the reviewers also expressed some level of uncertainty around a) the choice of time period boundaries (1.6) and b) the aggregating across all plots in a treatment (2.8, 2.9), I'm also inclined to explore sensitivities there and include that information either in the supplement or just in the response to reviewers.

Then there are a number of fairly self-explanatory changes to finesse language and clarify the description of the statistical models. 

Unless you have concerns, I'll go ahead and make these changes over break, and get back to you with a revision and response to reviewers when things pick up again in January?

Thanks!
